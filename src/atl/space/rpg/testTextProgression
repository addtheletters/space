-Darkness. It is dark. Darker than you have ever experienced before.
When was before? You don't care. It doesn't matter. All that matters
is the darkness, pressing in on you... Your eyes, are shut, but you
can feel the darkness nevertheless. You realize all of a sudden that 
you are not breathing.
	1>Open your eyes
	2>Keep your eyes closed
1>-You open your eyes. You see darkness. Big ******* surprise. Yet you can see. 
2>-You keep your eyes shut, unable or unwilling to confront the darkness, confront your fears.
	1>Unable
	2>Unwilling

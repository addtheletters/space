A space game / engine / thing. Will likely include gravity, collisions, and other stuff.

Wiki has mechanics info: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki

Dev diary: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki/Dev-Diary

Currrent Objective: Create data systems. Any advice is welcome :P

TODO:
- RPG mechanics
- Fix 'strong' turning
- Finish radiation / communications
- Finish data systems
- Finish heat systems
- EM / Light systems
- Make collisions work
- Add damage systems
- Make updates for components utilize delta time

Note: Files in glTest are entirely for testing and may represent various stages of development. Some may cease to work as coding proceeds.

Current GravityTest functionality:
- Draws a starfeild
- Draws a bunch of gravity-pullable objects, with orange triangle overlays
- Draws a bunch of stationary gravity pullers, with pink square overlays
- Also has carried over protagonist + semiworking missile + other entities from EntityTest


See wiki on GitHub for planned final game mechanics and other info.

Currrent Objective: Create data systems. Any advice is welcome :P

----UPDATE----
Hey, so what are the thoughts about multiplayer? -Zach
I'm not sure. It most definitley will not be turn-based so... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. It'd be really nice if we could make it work though. -Ben

space
=====

A space game / engine / thing. Will likely include gravity, collisions, and other stuff.

Wiki has mechanics info: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki

Dev diary: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki/Dev-Diary

Currrent Objective: Create data systems. Any advice is welcome :P

TODO:
- [ ] Test projectiles, missiles, TurnControl
- [ ] Make updates for components utilize delta time
- [ ] Make collisions work with ships and direction facings. Prolly gonna need some complicated trig -_-
- [ ] Information mechanics, data sources, etc (see wiki)
- [ ] Heat mapping, EM source mapping, figuring that out (see wiki/dev-diary)


Current EntityTest functionality:
-Draws a starfeild
-Draws a bunch of movers that leave fading trails
-Draws a bunch of controllable accelerator things with lots of options, with overlays
-Attempted missile launching, semi-working
-Attempted 'unit selection', semi-working



See wiki on GitHub for planned final game mechanics and other info.

----UPDATE----
Hey, so what are the thoughts about multiplayer? -Zach
I'm not sure. It most definitley will not be turn-based so... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. It'd be really nice if we could make it work though. -Ben

space
=====

A space game / engine / thing. Will likely include gravity, collisions, and other stuff.

Also, I need a much more descriptive README, such as

TODO, Release Notes, Version History

Umm... It's not really even a game yet so I'll hold off on version numbers for now...
Anyways...

Current Test3D functionality:
-Generates large grid of random points and lines
-X, Y and Z camera movement, determinable by mouse and keyboard, delta-adjusted for framerate
  -see comments in Test3D
-Vertex Buffer Object rendering

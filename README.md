space
=====

A space game / engine / thing. Will likely include gravity, collisions, and other stuff.

Wiki has mechanics info: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki

Dev diary: https://github.com/addtheletters/space/wiki/Dev-Diary

Currrent Objective: Create data systems. Any advice is welcome :P

TODO:
_ookay. It does use GFM, just it doesn't support the checkboxes cuz git pushing. Carry on!_
- Fix acceleration / engine systems so gravity and engines work right
- Alter / add to component ID system to make them easier to get
- Fix 'strong' turning
- Finish data systems
- Finish heat systems
- EM / Light systems
- Make collisions work
- Add damage systems
- Make updates for components utilize delta time

Current GravityTest functionality:
- Draws a starfeild
- Draws a bunch of gravity-pullable objects, with orange triangle overlays
- Draws a bunch of stationary gravity pullers, with pink square overlays
- Also has carried over protagonist + other entities from EntityTest

Current EntityTest functionality:
- Draws a starfeild
- Draws a bunch of movers that leave fading trails
- Draws a bunch of controllable accelerator things with lots of options, with overlays
- Attempted missile launching, semi-working
- Attempted 'unit selection', semi-working



See wiki on GitHub for planned final game mechanics and other info.

----UPDATE----
Hey, so what are the thoughts about multiplayer? -Zach
I'm not sure. It most definitley will not be turn-based so... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. It'd be really nice if we could make it work though. -Ben

space
=====

A space game / engine / thing. Will likely include gravity, collisions, and other stuff.

Also, I need a much more descriptive README, such as

TODO, Release Notes, Version History

Umm... It's not really even a game yet so I'll hold off on version numbers for now...
Anyways...

Using Vertex normalize method, small tweaks
